<h1>Solving the XOR Problem, from scratch in Numpy</h1>

Hello!

This is my first project on GitHub, and while it is a type of program I am familiar with (a neural network), I thought it would be a good exercise for teaching myself version control, as git is a system that I was not familiar with. I've also almost exclusively built NNs using libraries such as TF and PyTorch so I thought it would be fun to try and build one from the ground up, using only numpy for the math.

I plan on improving this neural network as time goes on, as well as writing similar versions in other languages that I know, in order to get a good sense of efficiency and to work on my ability to write fast code.
